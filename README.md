Discord Bot Development

## How to Use
- Replace the `token`, `clientId` and `guildId` in `config.json` with your own ID respectively.
- Edit slash commands or write new commands in `commands` folder. 
- Run `node deploy-commands.js` to deploy your commands to the Discord.
- Run `node index.js` to get your bot working.
- Back to your Discord group and begin to tap slash!
